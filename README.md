## THE PROBLEM

* Now days usage of oral medication is very high due to our modern health problems. But due to these busy times, people forget to take medicine at the correct time. This is frequent in the elderly. This could lead to mild to fatal consequences.

* THE SOLUTIONS PROVIDED BY THE MANUFACTURES ARE ONLY A MERE ALARM CLOCK THAT CAN HOLD MEDICINE.

## MOTIVATION AND JUSTIFICATION

* We select this project for elderly people and medicine takers who need to take the medicines at the correct times. Therefore, we used a survey to collect some information.
* FAMILY MEMBERS TAKE MEDICINE-63%
* PATIENT AGE ABOVE 50 - 76%
* PILL TYPE MEDICINE-88%
* FORGET TO TAKE MEDICINE-72%

## FUNCTIONALITY
* THE DEVICE IS TO STORE THE ORAL MEDICATION IN THE FORM OF PILLS. THE USER MUST INPUT MEDICAL DATA THROUGH THE TERMINAL. THE DEVICE STORES SUCH DATA AND USES IT TO REMIND THE USER AT THE TIME TO TAKE MEDICATION. RECORD THE USAGE(TAKING PILLS) OF THE PRODUCT AND GIVE FEED BACK WHEN THE PRODUCT IS NOT ACCESSED  TO THE CORRECT PERSON.


## HARDWARE COMPONENT FOR BASIC DESIGN
* Microcontroller (Atmega328p â€“pu)
* Servo motor(28BYJ-48) & driver
* Sim module(800L)
* Speaker
* Display (16x2LCD) and I2C module
* Power supply and regulator
* RTC module (DS 3231)

## TECHNICAL FEASIBILITY

* CIRCULAR ENCLOSURE DESIGN WITH 8 PARTITIONS THAT EACH     PARTITION CORRESPONDS WITH DIFFERENT MEDICINE.
* WE USE LCD DISPLAYS AND BUTTONS AS OUTPUT AND INPUT METHODS FOR DATA ENTRY.
* THE RTC MODULE USED TO TRACK TIME FOR REMINDER.
* MEDICATION WILL BE PROVIDED BY A SINGLE DOOR MECHANISM TO PREVENT TAKING THE WRONG MEDICINE.
* THE MEDICATION WILL BE PROVIDED ONE BY ONE BY ROTATING THE INNER BODY OF THE DEVICE ALIGNING WITH THE DOOR.
* THE DEVICE WILL BE POWERED BY A 9V BATTERY AND COULD BE CONNECTED WITH RESIDENTIAL CURRENT WITH AC/DC 5V ADAPTER.
* LEDS INDICATE THAT THE MEDICATION WAS ALREADY USED AT THAT TIME TO PREVENT UNNECESSARY OVERDOSE.
